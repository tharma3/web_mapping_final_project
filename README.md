# Final Project for NYU GIS Web Mapping

### Motivation

The purpose of this map is to show where New York's elder population is concentrated.  Older New Yorkers are particularly vulnerable in certain types of emergencies, and most emergency responses are place-based.  It's more important than ever to understand how older New Yorkers are distributed across the city.  I will continue to work on this project in the coming days and weeks and it may help inform outreach efforts for the City's food response.

### Data Sources

The data in this project come from the [US Census Bureau's American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (2009-2018)](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html) accessed via the API.  The Census Tract shapes come from the [New York City Department of City Planning](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/districts-download-metadata.page).

### Acknowledgements
